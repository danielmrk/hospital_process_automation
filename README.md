# hospital_process_automation

This Project implements a simulator in order to interact with the cpee.

## Usage

1. Start the simulator_test.py at the Lehre Server
2. Spawn Instances using the instanceSpawner.py

In every case if an Instance is spawned it has to come with two initial Data Elements

1. patientType
2. arrivalTime

The patientType can be:
- A1
- A2
- A3
- A4
- B1
- B2
- B3
- B4
- ER

The arrivaltime has to be given in minutes. The global time counting starts at 0 and ends after one year.
The initial start for arrivalTime is 500 minutes which is approximately 8:20 AM.
